# ASTR8100-Project

This project focuses on solving the radiative diffusion equation by using the two stream approximation most commonly found in atmospheres

Open the python notebook and get started by examining the current plots/equations. The user can feel free to adjust the values of epsilon and the range of tau at will.

Things left to develop include a Lambda Iteration version of the numerical analysis, and  a more robust system of finite difference solving.
